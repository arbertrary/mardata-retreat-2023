# Visual Analytics

## Data Visualization {.fragment}

Representing data in a way to be understood by humans

## Visual Data Exploration {.fragment}

Exploring data by interacting with visualizations

## Sensemaking {.fragment}
Gaining knowledge and insight through data exploration

# {.notes}

Overall, we are located in the area of Human-Computer Interaction or Human-Data Interaction. I will not go fully into detail here because the terms themselves are self-explanatory enough for this talk.

In contrast to e.g. automated data analytics by machine learning or other computer-based techniques, visual analytics is performed by humans through interaction with visualized data.

# Immersion {.columns}

## {.top}

>- A feeling of being **immersed** and **present** in a virtual environment
- Varying degrees and aspects of immersion (spatial immersion, 3D/stereoscopy, head tracking, surround sound, ...)
- Examples: *CAVE*s, Head-Mounted Displays, Domes (e.g. *ARENA2*)

# Immersive and Collaborative Visual Analytics

## Immersive Analytics {.fragment}

Visual data exploration inside an immersive virtual environment

<!-- *(@marriott2018immersive, @skarbez2019immersive, @fonnet2021survey)* -->

## Collaborative Visual Analytics {.fragment}
<!-- *The shared use of computer-supported, (interactive) visual representations of data by more than one person with the common goal of contribution to joint information processing activities.*   -->

Joint visual data exploration by more than one person

Can be co-located or not, synchronous or asynchronous

<!-- *(@keel2006collaborative, @heer2008design, @isenberg2011collaborative)* -->


## ARENA2 {.example .fragment}

**Environment for co-located, synchronous collaboration inside a spatially immersive setting.**

- Originally a video game engine
- Developed by Epic Games
- Today branded as *"powerful real-time 3D creation tool"*
- Free to use, source-available software
- Huge ecosystem
- Used in game development, architecture, simulation, research, film making ...

<h2>nDisplay Plugin</h2>

- Rendering Unreal Engine content in real-time to a cluster of nodes and multiple displays
- Tiled walls, curved screens, CAVEs, Domes (e.g. ARENA2)
- Use motion tracking and input devices (e.g. game controllers) to manipulate camera perspective and movement in scene

# Georeferencing Data

Geospatial data from the real world needs to be in a **Coordinate Reference System** to express the location and be able to make queries that give realistic results (e.g. real distance between two points in a 3D model)

- Latitude = Elevation in degrees to the Equator
- Longitude = Azimuth in degrees to the Prime Meridian (Greenwich)
- Altitude = Height in meters to the reference ellipsoid (i.e. an approximate representation of the Earth).

# Provenance


## {.example .fragment}

"*[...] is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form **assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness***"
 
\- World Wide Web Consortium [@2013provoverview]

# The Value of Visualization

##

The value is a trade-off between the costs (e.g. the effort to understand a visualization) and the gained knowledge.


*"Just claiming that a visualization gives insight is not enough, if we want to offer additional value."* [@vanwijk2005value]

<!-- ## {.example .fragment} -->

## Provenance and reproducibility make it possible to assess and increase the scientific value of a visualization {.fragment}

>- Capture Users reasoning processes by capturing internal (i.e. in-app interaction) and external (e.g. think-aloud, manual notes) information
- Capture visualization state history including undo-redo and branching actions
- Organize provenance and make it persistent and publishable in a "Digital Lab Book" [@bernstetter2023practical]
