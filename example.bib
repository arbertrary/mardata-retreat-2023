  abstract    = {Conducting data analysis tasks rarely occur in isolation. Especially in
intelligence analysis scenarios where different experts contribute knowledge to
a shared understanding, members must communicate how insights develop to
establish common ground among collaborators. The use of provenance to
communicate analytic sensemaking carries promise by describing the interactions
and summarizing the steps taken to reach insights. Yet, no universal guidelines
exist for communicating provenance in different settings. Our work focuses on
the presentation of provenance information and the resulting conclusions
reached and strategies used by new analysts. In an open-ended, 30-minute,
textual exploration scenario, we qualitatively compare how adding different
types of provenance information (specifically data coverage and interaction
history) affects analysts' confidence in conclusions developed, propensity to
repeat work, filtering of data, identification of relevant information, and
typical investigation strategies. We see that data coverage (i.e., what was
interacted with) provides provenance information without limiting individual
investigation freedom. On the other hand, while interaction history (i.e., when
something was interacted with) does not significantly encourage more mimicry,
it does take more time to comfortably understand, as represented by less
confident conclusions and less relevant information-gathering behaviors. Our
results contribute empirical data towards understanding how provenance
summarizations can influence analysis behaviors.},

To successfully analyze and validate various hypothesis, it is necessary to pose several queries, correlate disparate data, and create insightful visualizations of both the simulated processes and observed phenomena. Often, insight comes from comparing the results of multiple visualizations. Unfortunately, today this process is far from interactive and contains many error-prone and time-consuming tasks. As a result, the generation and maintenance of visualizations is a major bottleneck in the scientific process, hindering both the ability to mine scientific data and the actual use of the data. The VisTrails system represents our initial attempt to improve the scientific discovery process and reduce the time to insight. In VisTrails, we address the problem of visualization from a data management perspective: VisTrails manages the data and metadata of a visualization product. In this demonstration, we show the power and flexibility of our system by presenting actual scenarios in which scientific visualization is used and showing how our system improves usability, enables reproducibility, and greatly reduces the time required to create scientific visualizations.},

  abstract    = {Provenance-tracking is widely acknowledged as an important feature of visualization systems. By tracking provenance data, visualization designers can provide a wide variety of functionality, ranging from action recovery (undo/redo), reproducibility, collaboration and sharing, to logging in support of quantitative and longitudinal evaluation. However, no widely used library that can provide that functionality is current available. As a consequence, visualization designers either develop ad hoc solutions that are rarely comprehensive, or do not track provenance at all. In this paper, we introduce a web-based software library - Trrack - that is designed for easy integration in existing or future visualization systems. Trrack supports a wide range of use cases, from simple action recovery, to capturing intent and reasoning, and can be used to share states with collaborators and store provenance on a server. Trrack also includes an optional provenance visualization component that supports annotation of states and aggregation of events.},

On the Web, the interchange of standardized provenance of (linked) data is an essential step towards establishing trust [2]. One mechanism to track (part of) the provenance of data, is through the use of version control systems (VCS), such as Git. These systems are widely used to facilitate collaboration primarily for both code and data. Here, we describe a system to expose the provenance stored in VCS in a new standard Web-native format: W3C PROV [4]. This enables the easy publication of VCS provenance on the Web and subsequent integration with other systems that make use of PROV. The system is exposed as a RESTful Web service, which allows integration into user-friendly tools, such as browser plugins.},

The PROV set of specifications, produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), is designed to promote the publication of provenance information on the Web, and offers a basis for interoperability across diverse provenance management systems. The PROV provenance model is deliberately generic and domain-agnostic, but extension mechanisms are available and can be exploited for modelling specific domains. This tutorial provides an account of these specifications. Starting from intuitive and informal examples that present idiomatic provenance patterns, it progressively introduces the relational model of provenance along with the constraints model for validation of provenance documents, and concludes with example applications that show the extension points in use.},

The term, provenance, has been used in a variety of ways to describe different types of records and histories related to visualization. The existing body of provenance research has grown to a point where the consolidation of design knowledge requires cross-referencing a variety of projects and studies spanning multiple domain areas. We present an organizational framework of the different types of provenance information and purposes for why they are desired in the field of visual analytics. Our organization is intended to serve as a framework to help researchers specify types of provenance and coordinate design knowledge across projects. We also discuss the relationships between these factors and the methods used to capture provenance information. In addition, our organization can be used to guide the selection of evaluation methodology and the comparison of study outcomes in provenance research.},

Many methods and tools have been developed and published but most are stand-alone prototypes and have not reached a mature state that can be used in a reliable manner by collaborating domain scientists or a wider audience.

ODV lets the users maintain and analyze very large datasets on inexpensive and portable hardware. Various types of graphics output can be produced easily, including high-quality station maps, general property-property plots of one or more stations, scatter plots of selected stations, section plots along arbitrary cruise tracks, and property distributions on general isosurfaces. Commonly used isosurfaces are constant depth, density or temperature layers. ODV supports display of scalar and vector data by coloured dots, numerical data values or arrows. In addition, ODV includes three different gridding algorithms that calculate fields on automatically generated grids on the basis of the normally heterogeneously distributed data. Gridded fields can be contoured and colour shaded.

ODV has a large user community with almost 40,000 registered users worldwide.},

  abstract  = {This thesis introduces Potree, a web-based renderer for
               large point clouds. It allows users to view data sets with
               billions of points, from sources such as LIDAR or
               photogrammetry, in real time in standard web browsers. One
               of the main advantages of point cloud visualization in web
               browser is that it allows users to share their data sets
               with clients or the public without the need to install
               third-party applications and transfer huge amounts of data
               in advance. The focus on large point clouds, and a variety
               of measuring tools, also allows users to use Potree to look
               at, analyze and validate raw point cloud data, without the
               need for a time-intensive and potentially costly meshing
               step. The streaming and rendering of billions of points in
               web browsers, without the need to load large amounts of data
               in advance, is achieved with a hierarchical structure that
               stores subsamples of the original data at different
               resolutions. A low resolution is stored in the root node and
               with each level, the resolution gradually increases. The
               structure allows Potree to cull regions of the point cloud
               that are outside the view frustum, and to render distant
               regions at a lower level of detail. The result is an open
               source point cloud viewer, which was able to render point
               cloud data sets of up to 597 billion points, roughly 1.6
               terabytes after compression, in real time in a web browser.},

               hierarchical counting sort to quickly split the point cloud
               into small chunks, which are then processed in parallel.
               Levels of detail are generated by subsampling the full data
               set bottom up using one of multiple exchangeable sampling
               strategies. We introduce a fast hierarchical approximate
               blue-noise strategy and compare it to a uniform random
               sampling strategy. The throughput, including out-of-core
               access to disk, generating the octree, and writing the final
               result to disk, is about an order of magnitude faster than
               the state of the art, and reaches up to around 6 million
               points per second for the blue-noise approach and up to
               around 9 million points per second for the uniform random

@article{vazire2018implications,
  abstract = { The credibility revolution (sometimes referred to as the “replicability crisis”) in psychology has brought about many changes in the standards by which psychological science is evaluated. These changes include (a) greater emphasis on transparency and openness, (b) a move toward preregistration of research, (c) more direct-replication studies, and (d) higher standards for the quality and quantity of evidence needed to make strong scientific claims. What are the implications of these changes for productivity, creativity, and progress in psychological science? These questions can and should be studied empirically, and I present my predictions here. The productivity of individual researchers is likely to decline, although some changes (e.g., greater collaboration, data sharing) may mitigate this effect. The effects of these changes on creativity are likely to be mixed: Researchers will be less likely to pursue risky questions; more likely to use a broad range of methods, designs, and populations; and less free to define their own best practices and standards of evidence. Finally, the rate of scientific progress—the most important shared goal of scientists—is likely to increase as a result of these changes, although one’s subjective experience of making progress will likely become rarer. },

  abstract  = {Abstract There is fast-growing literature on provenance-related research, covering aspects such as its theoretical framework, use cases, and techniques for capturing, visualizing, and analyzing provenance data. As a result, there is an increasing need to identify and taxonomize the existing scholarship. Such an organization of the research landscape will provide a complete picture of the current state of inquiry and identify knowledge gaps or possible avenues for further investigation. In this STAR, we aim to produce a comprehensive survey of work in the data visualization and visual analytics field that focus on the analysis of user interaction and provenance data. We structure our survey around three primary questions: (1) WHY analyze provenance data, (2) WHAT provenance data to encode and how to encode it, and (3) HOW to analyze provenance data. A concluding discussion provides evidence-based guidelines and highlights concrete opportunities for future development in this emerging area. The survey and papers discussed can be explored online interactively at https://provenance-survey.caleydo.org.},
